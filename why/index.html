<p>Since the dawn of time (or at least, like, 1994), people have used the internet to troll* each other with unpleasant images. Goatse and Lemon Party ring any bells?</p>

<p>If you're a Redditor, you're probably familiar with the concept of a 'risky click'. This is, more often than not, a link to an Imgur URL that's made up of a string of random numbers and letters.</p>

<p>Whether it's marked as NSFW/NSFL or not, it's practically impossible to ignore a 'risky click'. It may be because you want to see what the link your friend has just sent you is or it may be because you want to prove that 'ur a real man'. Either way, we are all ruled by our sense of morbid curiosity.</p>

<p><a href="/">Blurr.im</a> is to risky clicks as watching through your fingers is to horror movies. No more squinting, no more taking off your glasses or getting up to turn all the lights on before you click <i>that</i> link.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you only get to 50% unblurred before thinking 'nope, I'm done'. We won't think any less of you. (Wuss.)</p>


<p class="small">* Oh, and that's troll in the actual sense of the word, not the BBC's 'this Twitter troll tweeted that they disagreed with someone! What a terrible bit of trolling by that troll!' definition.</p>
